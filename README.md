These pieces of art were created by Jeremy Blake, a new media artist that passed away in 2007. The first image, The Witchâ€™s Cap, is a digital c-print. This image stood out to me because it looks like it might either be a photoraph or even a painting, but it is neither. I thought that the way in which the yellow and pink lines framed the picture make it seem as though the image features a street or an alley way. Lining this alley are the images of the masked woman, the house, the landscape, the rose, etc. as screens on a wall. To me, it is easy to imagine someone walking down that path, being engulfed by the futuristic, flashing, and distracting images that are relentlessly forced into their vision.

The second image, called The Disappearing Floor, is also a c-print. When I first looked at this image, I thought that it looked like an art gallery in which the piece in the middle was the centerpiece of the display. As I started looking closer, the rest of the scene came into focus more, and I began to notice the details of the rest of the room (the floors, windows, walls, etc.) that were at first masked by the streaks of color at the forefront. Once I noticed the rest of the scene Blake had portrayed, the disappearing black/white floor started to look like it was, in fact, disappearing and melting away. I also really loved how the streaks of color in the forefront of the piece of art are mirrored in the more focused square in the middle of the art.
